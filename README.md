### What does "cognitive" mean?

The word *“cognitive”* comes from the word *“cognition,”* which means the way our *mind processes information*.

It includes all the *mental activities* we do when we:

* *Pay attention*
* *Understand* things
* *Learn* new stuff
* *Remember* past events
* *Solve problems*
* *Make decisions*
* *Use language*

### Real-life examples of cognitive activities:

* *Learning* a new language → your brain is figuring out sounds, words, and grammar.
* *Remembering* what you studied for a test → using your memory.
* *Solving* a puzzle or riddle → using logic and problem-solving.
* *Noticing* when someone is sad just by looking at their face → using your brain to understand emotions (called social cognition).

### Why is it important?

Cognitive skills help us do everything in daily life — from simple tasks like reading a sign to more complex ones like planning your future or understanding other people’s feelings.

### Summary:

*Cognitive* means anything that has to do with *thinking, understanding, remembering, learning, or making decisions.* It's how your brain helps you make sense of the world and respond to it.
